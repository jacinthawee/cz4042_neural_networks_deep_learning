# CZ4042 Deep Learning and Neural Network Final Project

Material Recognition
The goal of this project is to train a convolutional neural network to classify color photographs of surfaces
into one of ten common material categories: fabric, foliage, glass, leather, metal, paper, plastic, stone,
water, and wood. Some tasks to consider:

1. Modify some previously published architectures e.g., increase the network depth, reducing their
parameters, etc.
2. Try data augmentation to increase the number of training images
3. Try a larger dataset, Materials in Context Database (MINC)
