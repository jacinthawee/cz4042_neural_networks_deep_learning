- To run the webapp, download the files and run it using R-Studio by clicking on the green play button.
- Remember to download the model in the www folder first (go check the README.md in the www folder on how to do so).
- If there is any problem with the running of the model, remember to uncomment reticulate::install_miniconda() in the global file. Ensure that the version of tensorflow in your R is 2.6.2
